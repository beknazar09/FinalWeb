# ToDo Web App (Full Stack JavaScript Application)

## Technologies
* Front-end: Vue.js
* Back-end: Node.js
* Database: PostgreSQL

## Background
This project was initialy started as a solution for organizing which tasks to do during a buy day or week. I hope to gain experience in building a full-stack web app using JavaScript. JavaScript is the language of choice (other than because I'm building a web app) because of how simple it is to create nice looking GUIs. For the backend, I chose to use Node.js because of how lightweight it is. Although a PostgreSQL database is overkill for this type of project, I wanted to use it such that I get more experience working with it for much bigger projects in the future.
